# avengers-superhero-app


This project is a basic HTML-based image gallery webpage that showcases images from the Avengers movie series. It includes a navigation menu and a clickable image gallery leading to individual pages.

## Features

- Simple navigation menu with links to:
  - Home
  - About
  - Contact
- Clickable image gallery displaying six Avengers-related images
- Each image links to a separate HTML page (`avengers-1.html` to `avengers-6.html`)

## File Structure

- `index.html` – Main gallery page (this file)
- `about.html` – About page (not included here)
- `contact.html` – Contact page (not included here)
- `style.css` – External CSS file for styling (not included here)
- `images/` – Folder containing Avengers images (e.g., `avengers_01.jpg`, etc.)

## Notes

- Ensure all linked HTML pages and images exist in the correct folders.
- Update the `<title>` tag with a descriptive title for better SEO and accessibility.
- Replace backslashes (`\`) in image paths with forward slashes (`/`) for cross-browser compatibility.

## Example Image Tag Fix
```html
<img src="images/avengers_01.jpg" />
